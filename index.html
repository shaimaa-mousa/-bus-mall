    the cdn it's like a server near to me has a same information to device faraway about my device, this server being on the middle to be near to both devices, it's save time in sending request and receiving response -->
<!-- Now that we have a canvas we can use, we need to include Chart.js in our page. -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script> <!-- it contain all the code of chart.js -->
